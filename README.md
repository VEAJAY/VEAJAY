# *`[Hello World!]`* I'm Jayland Veasey!
### A bit about yours truly...

I've been enjoying coding ever since I made my first video game at the age of 14! How many middle-school kids can do that! 😎 Througout the years, I've shifted gears over to application development, ideally for the front end. If you're looking for a problem-solver, let's chat!

- ⭐ I'm currently learning `React.js` and AWS
- 🎓 Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering
- 🎮 Gameplay designer using Unreal Engine 5
- 💪 Love to excercise and learn new skills in my free time
